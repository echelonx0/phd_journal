# Study Journal - 2025-02-21

## Tasks for today:
- Read chapter two of Authoring a PhD by Patrick Dunleavy
- Make notes to reflect on

## Notes:
- You ask the question, you provide the answer
- A Phd question should not be too wide
- It should also not be too narrow 
- It shouldn' also focus on targeting gaps in the knowledge base alone, becasuse those gaps may exist for a good reason that isn't immediately apparent, or are about to be filled before my own research is done
- Ideally, I should aim to frame my research question as a problem that I am in a unique position to answer.

I really liked this - and I will be reflecting on it for the rest of this week - 

"It is best to try and frame your thesis around an inellectual problem or a paradox, no a gap. It needs to focus on a set of phenomena that ask for an explanation, which you can express as a non-obvious puzzle, and for which you can formulate an interesting and effective answer.
