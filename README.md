Hereâ€™s your **automated script** and a **GitHub repository description** for your PhD study journal.

### **Automated Script for Daily Journal Entries**
This script will:
- Create a new journal entry for the day.
- Pre-fill it with a standard template.
- Commit and push the changes to your Git repository.

#### **Steps to Set Up**:
1. Save the script as `add_journal_entry.sh` in your `phd-journal` directory:
   ```bash
   nano add_journal_entry.sh
   ```
2. Copy and paste the following script:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Get today's date
   today=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   journal_dir="journal"
   entry_file="$journal_dir/$today.md"

   # Ensure the journal directory exists
   mkdir -p $journal_dir

   # Check if the entry already exists
   if [ -f "$entry_file" ]; then
       echo "Journal entry for $today already exists!"
   else
       # Create a new journal entry with a template
       cat <<EOT > "$entry_file"
   # Study Journal - $today

       echo "New journal entry created: $entry_file"
   fi

   # Add, commit, and push changes
   git add "$entry_file"
   git commit -m "Added journal entry for $today"
   git push origin main

   echo "Journal entry committed and pushed to Git."
   ```
3. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x add_journal_entry.sh
   ```
4. **Run the script daily**:
   ```bash
   ./add_journal_entry.sh
   ```

### **GitHub Repository Description**
---
#### **PhD Research Journal: Legal & Policy Challenges in African Maritime Cabotage**  
This repository serves as a **daily research journal** tracking my progress in developing a PhD proposal focused on the **legal and policy challenges of implementing a continental cabotage system in Africa**.  

### **Research Focus**  
The African Unionâ€™s commitment to a **continental cabotage system** (Article 15 of the Revised African Maritime Transport Charter) aims to enhance intra-African trade and economic integration. However, legal and policy challenges remain largely unexplored. This study will critically analyze:  
1. **Harmonization of national cabotage laws.**  
2. **Reconciliation of competing maritime interests among African states.**  
3. **Alignment of cabotage policies with regional integration goals.**  

### **Repository Structure**  
ðŸ“‚ `journal/` - Daily study logs and notes.  
ðŸ“„ `README.md` - Overview of the research project.  
ðŸ“‚ `resources/` - Papers, reports, and reference materials.  

### **Objectives**  
- Identify legal barriers to harmonization of cabotage laws.  
- Develop a framework to balance competing maritime interests.  
- Align cabotage policies with **AfCFTA** and African maritime growth.  

### **How to Use This Repo**  
This repository is updated daily with **new research insights, questions, and next steps**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Follow along for updates on legal reforms, policy innovations, and comparative maritime law research.**
